simple java problem including all basic concepts :)
To run the program using jdk-21 on cmd:
1. create a directory(folder) called emailapp in the folder you store all your java projects.
2. first save Email file as Email.java inside the directory emailapp.
3. also save EmailApp as EmailApp.java inside the directory emailapp.
4. now, compile email as javac emailapp/Email.
5. similarly, compile emailapp as javac email/EmailApp.
